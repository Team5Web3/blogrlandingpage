Hello, Everyone.

This is a Frontend Design Project intended to sharpen our skills in HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for the Web 3.0.

It's a collaborative project carried out by the members of Team 5 in a budding Web 3.0 Community on Discord.

The actual project we were assigned to recreate is located in the Design Folder - both desktop and mobile versions.

Our attempted work is open to corrections and feedback; it is the index.html file, while the mobile version can be viewed by testing the responsiveness through resizing.
