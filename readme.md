Hello, Everyone.

This is a Frontend Design Project intended to sharpen our skills in HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for the Web 3.0.

It's a collaborative project carried out by the members of Team 5 in a budding Web 3.0 Community on Discord.

The actual project we were assigned to recreate is located in the Design Folder - both desktop and mobile versions.

Our attempted work is open to corrections and feedback; it is the index.html file, while the mobile version can be viewed by testing the responsiveness through resizing.


Participants in this work according to their Github Links are as follows;

1. https://github.com/goonerlabs
2. https://github.com/Favytechs
3. https://github.com/Eceegit
4. https://github.com/Meauma13



Some challenges encountered and learning insihgts gained during the course of this project include;

a. Figuring out how to optimally scale, resize and position the SVG files.
b. Using the "order" CSS feature of flex display to position elements.
c. Proper use of the Bootstrap Grid column "col" feature to achieve responsive display on mobile and larger screen sizes.
d. Realizing that there was need for potential landscape responsiveness, which led to reading up on @meadia screen and (min-height: ..px) or (max-height: ..px).



Further Learning Goals

1. Landscape Orientation Use Cases (min-height) and (max-height)
2. SVG Use Cases
